# <a href="https://elementor.com/?utm_source=github-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=code-of-conduct">![logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1778512/191041718-728d179e-07cb-4cb4-953a-6c294ee8c4db.png)</a>

**This is a collaborative space for developers, enthusiasts, and users alike to contribute, share ideas, and help shape the future of Elementor.**

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open, inclusive, and welcoming environment, we strive to maintain in all collaborative spaces a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of experience level, ability, disability, socioeconomic status, age, appearance, nationality, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, or religion.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in any thread, as well as the consequences of unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## Guidelines

To ensure everyone has a good experience, we outlined a few rules that should be followed and enforced by all participants.

### Be respectful and empathetic
We embrace healthy conversations but don't tolerate behavior that disrespects or discriminates against other contributors or maintainers. Be aware of diverse backgrounds and perspectives. Let's make this a safe space for everyone to contribute and share ideas.

### Be welcoming and open-minded
Our spaces are filled with contributors at different experience levels. Be receptive to other ideas or points of view, and welcoming to all contributors, especially those who are inexperienced.

### Be constructive and keep the conversation on-topic
Criticize ideas, not people. Explain your thoughts and keep discussions relevant to Elementor products. We don't engage in talks about politics, religion, or other unrelated topics. Complaints about support, the Elementor company, its employees, other products, or anyone else will be removed at our discretion without warning.

### Keep it tidy
Organize and submit your issues, discussions, and comments properly:
- Troubleshoot your issues before posting.
- Search before creating new threads.
- Post in the correct channels.
- Provide instant and thorough information, especially when asked.
- Stay on topic.
- Submit your own threads instead of using other threads to make other requests or report other issues.
- Instead of commenting "+1" or "Agreed", use the upvote button when available.

## Expected behaviors
We're here to create a positive environment. Always be respectful, show empathy, respect differing opinions, give and accept feedback gracefully, apologize for mistakes, and focus on the community's good.

## Unacceptable behaviors
Please avoid inappropriate behavior, including using offensive or sexualized language, trolling, harassment, disclosing private information without permission, spam or off-topic discussions, and posting complaints about the Elementor company or other subjects.

## Enforcement

Our maintainers will enforce these guidelines and take fair action if necessary. We reserve the right to close, lock, or remove any thread or comment at any time without warning or explanation. The continuation of inappropriate behavior will result in a permanent ban at our discretion.

This Code of Conduct applies to all Elementor GitHub pages and spaces, including but not limited to Issues and Discussions.

If you wish to file a complaint, please [reach out to Elementor Support](https://elemn.to/contact).
