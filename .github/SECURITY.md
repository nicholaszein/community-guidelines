# How to report Security Issues

Security is paramount at Elementor. If you discover a security vulnerability, we want to hear about it right away, and we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a coordinated manner. For this reason, we run a community-driven [Managed Security Bug Bounty program](https://elemn.to/bug-bounty).

We leverage the collective expertise of our community, offering round-the-clock crowdsourced vulnerability detection. The program provides a comprehensive overview of features and endpoints considered 'in scope,' reward specifics, and our complete terms and conditions.

## Please do not report security issues on GitHub
