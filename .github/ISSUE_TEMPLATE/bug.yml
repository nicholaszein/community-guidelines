        ### üôè Follow these best practices to help save you time
        - üîç **Search Before Posting:** Before creating a new Bug Report, please search for similar issues to prevent creating duplicates.
        - üÜï **Stay Up-to-date:** Make sure you are using the most recent and stable versions of [Elementor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/#developers), [Elementor Pro](https://elementor.com/pro/changelog/), [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/download/releases/), and your theme.
        - üî¨ **Isolate the problem:** Deactivate all of your plugins, and temporarily change your WordPress theme to [Hello theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/hello-elementor/). If this solves the problem, gradually activate your plugins and theme one by one, until you spot the conflicting plugin or theme.
        - üïµÔ∏è **Validate Your Issue:** If the issue can't be recreated consistently or reproduced on other sites, it's not an Elementor bug. In that case, use one of the support links above.
        - üß© **Contact 3rd-party Support:** If the issue happens with an Elementor add-on, extension, compatible plugin, or integrated theme, contact their support first. We do not provide support for 3rd-party software.
        - 1Ô∏è‚É£ **One Issue Per Thread:** If you are experiencing more than one bug, submit only **<ins>ONE ISSUE</ins>** per thread, so we can properly track them and reference them without any confusion.
