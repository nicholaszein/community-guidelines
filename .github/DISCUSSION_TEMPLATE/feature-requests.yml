        ## ‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE POSTING YOUR REQUEST
        ### üôè Follow these best practices to help save you time
        - üîç **Search Before Posting:** Before creating a new Feature Request, please search for similar Request to prevent creating duplicates.
        - üÜï **Stay Up-to-date:** Make sure you are using the most recent and stable versions of [Elementor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/elementor/#developers), and [Elementor Pro](https://elementor.com/pro/changelog/), and that the request you're suggesting is not already available with the latest versions.
        - ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **Use the Upvote Button:** Rather than posting ‚Äú+1‚Äù or ‚ÄúAgreed‚Äù on threads, use the upvote button to express your opinion. 
        - 1Ô∏è‚É£ **One Request Per Thread:** If you have more than one request, please submit only **<ins>ONE REQUEST PER THREAD</ins>**, so we can properly track them and reference them without any confusion.
