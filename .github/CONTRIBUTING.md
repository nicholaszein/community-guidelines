## How to report Security Issues

At Elementor we take security very seriously. For this reason, we run a community-driven [Managed Security Bug Bounty program](https://elemn.to/bug-bounty).

We leverage the collective expertise of our community, offering round-the-clock crowdsourced vulnerability detection. The program provides a comprehensive overview of features and endpoints considered 'in scope,' reward specifics, and our complete terms and conditions.

<h3>Please do not report security issues on GitHub</h3>

Join our [Managed Security Bug Bounty program](https://elemn.to/bug-bounty) instead and help us maintain Elementor a secure software for all in a responsible way.
