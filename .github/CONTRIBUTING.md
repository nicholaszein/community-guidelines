## How to use GitHub

<br>Communication should always be in **English**.

For any other topic, please use other channels. For all things Elementor visit our website: [https://elementor.com](https://elementor.com/?utm_source=github-repo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=contribution).

## How to report Security Issues

Security is paramount at Elementor. If you discover a security vulnerability, we want to hear about it right away, and we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a coordinated manner. For this reason, we run community-driven [Managed Security Bug Bounty programs](https://elemn.to/gh-to-bounty-programs).

We leverage the collective expertise of our community, offering round-the-clock crowdsourced vulnerability detection. These programs provide a comprehensive overview of features and endpoints considered 'in scope,' reward specifics where relevant, and our complete terms and conditions.

### Please do not report security issues on GitHub

Join our [Managed Security Bug Bounty programs](https://elemn.to/gh-to-bounty-programs) instead and help us maintain Elementor, a secure software, responsibly.

**To learn more about our security efforts and how to contact us for security inquiries, please visit our [Trust Center](https://elemn.to/gh-to-trust-center).**

## How to Report a Bug

If you found a bug in the source code and can reproduce it consistently after troubleshooting it, you can help us by [submitting a Bug Report](https://elemn.to/gh-new-bug-report).

### Requirements

To help us review and resolve your report efficiently, all submitted bug reports must meet the following requirements. These rules ensure that reported issues are actionable, reproducible, and relevant.

- **All fields in the bug report form are required — no exceptions.**  
  Missing or incomplete information leads to unnecessary delays and often makes issues unreviewable. Issues missing required fields may be closed without review.

- **Search for similar issues before opening a new one.**  
  Duplicate reports create unnecessary noise and slow down the triaging process. Before posting, search the [open and closed issues](https://elemn.to/gh-issues) to see if your problem has already been reported or addressed.

- **Ensure you are using the latest stable versions.**  
  Bugs that occur in outdated versions may already be fixed. Please make sure Elementor, Elementor Pro, WordPress core, your theme, and all plugins are up to date.  
  Check the [changelog](https://elemn.to/changelog).

- **Clear all levels of cache.**  
  Issues caused by outdated or conflicting cached data are common. Before submitting a report, clear your browser cache, CDN cache, plugin cache, and server cache — in that order — to avoid false positives.

- **Test with only Elementor, Elementor Pro, and the Hello Elementor theme active.**  
  Conflicts from third-party plugins or themes are not actionable by our team. Isolate the issue by deactivating all unrelated plugins and switching to the Hello theme before reporting the problem.  
  See: [Troubleshooting the Editor](https://elemn.to/help-troubleshooting)

- **Include your full Elementor System Info.**  
  This diagnostic report helps us understand your environment and replicate the issue. Reports submitted without this information will be closed.  
  [How to get your System Info](https://elemn.to/help-system-info)

- **If you are a third-party developer, please identify yourself.**  
  Include your name, company, and a way to reach you. If your report involves compatibility with your own plugin, theme, or integration, this helps us follow up appropriately.

- **Only one issue per report.**  
  Submitting multiple bugs in a single issue makes tracking and resolving them harder. Please open separate reports for separate problems.

### Scope

We can only accept bug reports that fall within the scope of what we actively support. Submissions that do not meet this criteria will be closed without action.

- **Requests for personal support**  
  GitHub is not an efficient support channel. For assistance with setup, common issues, troubleshooting, or how-to questions, please contact our [Support Team](https://elemn.to/support-ticket) or visit our [Help Center](https://elemn.to/help).

- **Conflicts with third-party plugins, themes, or services**  
  If the issue only occurs when using tools not officially supported by Elementor, please contact the third-party developer. We do not triage or resolve external compatibility issues.

- **Feature requests or missing functionality**  
  If something is not broken but simply not yet supported, it's not a bug. Please use the [Feature Request form](https://elemn.to/gh-new-feature-request) instead.

- **Custom code and unsupported modifications**  
  We cannot help debug issues related to custom snippets, hooks, filters, overrides, or undocumented modifications. Refer to our [Developer Documentation](https://elemn.to/dev-docs) if you're building custom integrations.

- **Security issues**  
  We take security very seriously. And we want to resolved in a responsible manner. Please, do not disclose vulnerabilities as bug reports. Use our [Bug Bounty Program](https://elemn.to/gh-to-bounty-programs) for coordinated and responsible security reporting.

- **Complaints, negative feedback, or inappropriate content**  
  GitHub issues are not the right place for complaints about Elementor's products, services, or policies. We also do not tolerate hostile, discriminatory, or disrespectful remarks. See our [Code of Conduct](https://elemn.to/gh-code-of-conduct).

- **Invalid, incomplete, or vague reports**  
  Reports missing required fields, lacking reproduction steps, or submitted without proper validation will be closed to maintain the quality and focus of the issue tracker.

### Instructions

To ensure we can understand and resolve the issue effectively, follow these writing guidelines when filling out the form:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title**  
  A well-written title helps other users (and our team) quickly understand what the report is about and whether it might be related to other reports.

- **Describe the issue in detail**  
  Explain what happened, when it happened, and what part of Elementor is affected. Include any error messages, behavior patterns, and relevant context. Screenshots and screen recordings are especially helpful.

- **List all steps to reproduce the issue**  
  Reproduction steps are essential for verifying and fixing bugs. Provide a step-by-step list of what you did, so we can reproduce it - ideally on a clean WordPress install. If we cannot reproduce the issue, we cannot resolve it.

- **Explain what you expected to happen**  
  Make clear what the correct or intended behavior should be. This helps us understand if the issue is due to a bug, a misunderstanding, or a missing feature.

**As a gentle reminder, issues that do not meet these guidelines may be closed without further action. These standards ensure that our team and community contributors can manage reports effectively and focus on actionable feedback.**
