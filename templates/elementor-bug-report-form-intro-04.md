### 📋 Requirements

For a quick review and efficient resolution, please ensure your report meets the following requirements:

- *️⃣ **All fields in this form are required.** <br>Incomplete issues will be closed without exception.

- 💾 **Attach your complete Elementor System Info.** <br>This is not optional. Reports without the full Elementor System Info will be closed. <br>👉 Learn how to copy it here: https://elemn.to/help-system-info

- 🔍 **Search for similar issues before opening a new one.** <br>Avoid duplicates and save everyone's time. Use GitHub Labels and keywords to narrow down results.

- 🆕 **Ensure you are using the latest stable versions.** <br>Including Elementor, Elementor Pro, WordPress core, your active theme, and all installed plugins. <br>👉 Stay updated: https://elemn.to/changelog

- 🗑️ **Clear all relevant cache layers.** <br>Confirm the issue is not being caused by stale or cached data. <br>Please clear server cache, site-level cache (including plugin-based cache), CDN cache, and your browser cache — in that order.

- 🕵️ **Test with only Elementor, Elementor Pro, and the Hello Theme active.** <br>Temporarily disable all other plugins and themes. This step helps confirm that the issue is not being caused by a 3rd-party conflict. <br>👉 Reference: https://elemn.to/help-troubleshooting

- 🪪 **If you’re a 3rd-party developer**, please introduce yourself. <br>Include your name, company, product name, and a way for us to contact you (such as an email address). <br>This helps us collaborate more effectively.

- ☝️ **Only one issue per report.** <br>Please don’t bundle multiple bugs in a single submission. This helps us track, reproduce, and fix each issue accurately.
<br>
<br>

### 🎯 Scope

To keep this repository focused and efficient, there are some types of reports that we are unable to handle here. These types of issues will be **closed without further action**. 

- 🛟 **Requests for personal support** <br>This includes help with setup, troubleshooting, or usage guidance. For that, please contact our **[official support channels](https://elemn.to/support-ticket)**.

- 🧩 **Conflicts with 3rd-party plugins, themes, or services** <br>We’re only able to address issues related to Elementor and Elementor Pro directly. If the problem occurs when using a plugin, theme, or integration that is not officially supported by Elementor, please reach out to the 3rd-party provider for assistance.

- 🚀 **Feature requests or suggestions** <br>We love your ideas! But this form is only for confirmed bugs. Please use the dedicated Feature Request form instead. <br>See: **[Request a Feature](https://elemn.to/gh-new-feature-request)**

- 📚 **Questions about custom code or extending Elementor** <br>We cannot provide assistance with writing or debugging custom code. If you’re building with the Elementor API, we recommend using our **[Developer Center](https://elemn.to/dev-center)**.

- 🛡️ **Security and vulnerability disclosures** <br>We take security seriously. Please use our managed [Bug Bounty Programs](https://elemn.to/gh-to-bounty-programs) to responsibly report security issues.

- ☹️ **Complaints or offensive content** <br>This is not the place to submit complaints about Elementor’s products or services. We also do not tolerate offensive, discriminatory, or hostile remarks. Please keep discussions respectful as outlined in our **[Code of Conduct](https://elemn.to/gh-code-of-conduct)**.

- ❌ **Incomplete, invalid, or out-of-scope reports** <br>Issues without clear steps to reproduce, missing required fields, or unrelated to Elementor or Elementor Pro will be closed so we can focus on reports that help improve the product.
<br>

## 📝 Instructions

To make it easier for the team to understand and resolve your issue, please follow these best practices:

- ✒️ **Write a clear and descriptive title** <br>A good title helps others quickly understand what the issue is about. Try to summarize the problem in a few words.

- 💬 **Describe the issue in detail** <br>Include as much context as you can. What happened? When did it start? What page or feature does it affect? <br>Feel free to attach screenshots or screen recordings — just drag and drop them into the text field when filling out the form.

- 👣 **List all steps to reproduce the issue** <br>Be specific! We need to follow the same steps you took to trigger the bug, ideally on a clean WordPress installation. <br>Reports without clear reproduction steps may be closed, as we cannot fix what we cannot replicate.

- 🧠 **Explain what you expected to happen** <br>Let us know what the intended behavior is. If you were expecting a feature that does not exist, it might not be a bug — in that case, please submit a Feature Request instead. You can find the link in the 🔗 **Quick Links** section.
